# CirrusMD-React-Native-SDK-Example

**_Beta Note: react-native-cirrusmd-sdk is currently in beta and does not contain all of the features available in the native CirrussMD SDKs. A full release will be available in the future._**

A sample project demonstrating a simple integration of [react-native-cirrusmd-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cirrusmd-sdk) into a React Native app. This sample connects to a simple sandboxed environment, not a production level environment. Additionally the code in the sample app here is not meant to be production ready, just a simple demonstration.
